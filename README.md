# Deep_Learning
This is my first Deep Learning Model based on fashion mnist dataset for image classification. This is a basic Deep Learning model based on ANN

This model is an image classification problem where the dataset details are as follow:
                * 70,000 low images of resolution 28x28
                * The labels are clothing type classifications
                * Output label classification has 10 classes
                * Label classes are as follow:
                                    0. 'T-shirt/top'
                                    1.'Trowser'
                                    2.'Pullover'
                                    3.'Dress'
                                    4.'Coat'
                                    5.'Sandal'
                                    6.'Shirt'
                                    7.'Sneaker'
                                    8.'Bag'
                                    9.'Ankle_boot'
